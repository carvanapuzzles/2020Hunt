    Some salty old seahands are recounting some episodes down by the dock. Like any good fish tale, though, they're all stretching the truth a little bit

        I called an old, pathetic, acquaintance I hadn't seen in a while. Though our paths had diverged, he instantly remembered me. I'm quite memorable. I was surprised to learn he was able to cover for me at a prestigious event, though I had my doubts. I attended the event, ready to witness the spectacle that was sure to ensue. When I saw the motley crew he rolled in with, I was elated. They had only met to practice 7 times! Astoundingly, somehow, things went smoothly, much to my chagrin. It was too much for me and I ended up fainting. I could go on longer but I need to go talk to my kid, she's in trouble for skipping school.

        It was the first day of my new role. Right off the bat I made some executive changes to the dress code which were met with mixed reviews. Undeterred, I decided to lean further into my vision and, after a quick brainstorming session, executed a much bigger strategic shift. Some signs of trouble started to appear as even the most basic requests weren't being fulfilled correctly. I tried getting rid of some outdated equipment, limiting our product offering to just 4 choices, and shifting some employee roles around but it only resulted in losing more support. My plan really wasn't working. I was let go shortly thereafter but I think it all worked out for the best. Those memories really stress me out, I'm going to go play some games on my ship's deck.

        I'll be honest, I got out of there as fast as I could, what with the sirens and flashing lights and whatnot. How he ever found me I'll never know, but his kind words stuck with me as I fought back tears and headed home. There was an opportunity here. The next day I accompanied him on an outing and, after reconciling some differences on a 10-part initialism, we sang a duet. Though some questioned our friendship, I knew that this was the time. I finally had what I was looking for. Sadly, it all went south at the movies that afternoon. I lost everything and ended up running for my life. Alright, I need to head off to my overnight work.

        A potentially excellent evening was instantly ruined for me when 9 rolled around. Things quickly went from bad to worse due to the company present, but I tried to salvage it with some improv. My character's backstory wasn't the most realistic, but my audience seemed engaged anyways. They later found time for some sanitary chores while I questioned that choices that brought us here. Suddenly, the electrical circuits started failing amid other chaos at the same time an unexpected guest joined the gathering. Fortunately, he brought more answers than questions and we eventually tied off all the loose ends. OK--I better scurry, I need to go look at what the barometer is telling me.

        I woke up, did some exercise in my home gym (5 reps, of course), then jogged into town. I tried to pump myself up with limited success, but thankfully a friend came along and was able to restore my self-confidence! Though tripping over a nail briefly threw me for a loop, I was thrilled moments later to be sent on a quest to find a rare item. A quick shopping trip proved to be successful--and just in the nick of time! It seemed that while I was away, some new arrivals had created a precarious situation only I could remedy. Of course, I did so without too much trouble and, in doing so, achieved a lifelong dream! Anyways, I better get going, I'm going to go shopping for some agressive footwear.

        Doomsday was nigh! I burst through the door and spread the news, but no one took me seriously! At last, someone did. Later on that day, he disappeared and I was shocked find he'd ignored my warning! I think the 7 friends I found him with were bad influences. This time I made him promise to be more careful. Leaving things to chance was too risky, though. I needed to make sure the lesson hit home. I enlisted the help of an acquaintance to really drive the point home and, this time, I think it stuck. Nothing like some public humiliation to learn a lesson! Thanks for listening to me ramble, I'm off to go write a job posting.

        A relaxing afternoon enjoying nature ramped up very quickly as my pal and I surprisingly disagreed about our physical prowess. I quickly demonstrated my superiority in the first contest and only lost the rematch due to a cheap head start utilizing a piece of outdated technology. This really got under my skin. I tried to reclaim some of my bravado but, I was quickly ganged up on by the local crowd. Their mocking provoked me to make a dangerous decision that almost went very south. I had to throw down the gauntlet. 5 folks accepted my counter-challenge and, though they initially appeared to prevail, ended up in a precarious spot themselves! Gotta go now, gonna go hang out with some music nerds.

        It was a peaceful day and I was watching television. Suddenly, out of nowhere, 3 miscreants trespassed into my residence! I drew my weapon and attacked. Ever the accurate shot, I neutralized one of the intruders. Unfortunately, the conflict escalated and, after taking quite a fall, my associate and I ended up in the hospital. Upon coming to, I received an urgent phone call requesting my services at an event. Being unable to attend due to our injuries, my associate and I found some surrogates to send in our place. Everything went off without a hitch. Oddly enough though, there was an angry mob waiting for me when I was released! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go listen to <em>Aim and Ignite</em> and <em>Some Nights</em>.
